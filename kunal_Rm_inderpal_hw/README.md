I would like to type about a topic - 

CLOTHING
People care much about clothing, as it is important also. It is the thing in which not everyone but many of us are interested.
The trend of clothing going in fall 2021:
The revival of 90's clothes,
hues which are going to be saturated,
loose fitting denims,
Vests (sweater),
Jeans which are going to be printed.

Clothing tells about person's choice but we do not have to judge anyone. But well collection of clothes and a better style of clothing is good to have.
